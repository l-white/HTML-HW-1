              <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will admit it:  I am a certified bibliophile. I love to read. Alice Sebold once said that she reads the way some people overeat. After reading a book, her head hurts, and she thinks, oh, I shouldn't have read that so fast! I can relate. My love for reading started with bedtime stories and story hour at the Barrington Area Library, and continued throughout college. Was majoring in English simply a way to read more? Perhaps.</p>

              <h3>Favorite Pastime</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I said stamp collecting, would you believe me? Well, it's not stamp collecting. When I think of pastimes, I think family. I think one of my favorite pastimes is ice skating on the frozen lake behind my friend Megan's house. When I was young, I didn't mind the winter or the cold, especially if it meant ice skating, followed by hot chocolate.</p>

            <h4>Coffee with Friends</h4>
            <p>My favorite places to meet a friend for coffee in Milwaukee is Colectivo. When the weather is decent, it's a wonderful experience to sit outside, people watch, and connect with a good friend.</p>

            <h4>Bike Riding</h4>
            <p>Riding a bike downhill makes me feel incredibly carefree and youthful, so much so that I don't mind the occasional hill, which typically isn't a problem in the Midwest.</p>

            <h4>Photography</h4>
            <p>I became interested in photography in college and worked semi-professionally for a wedding photographer. Since then, landscape photography has become a wonderful source of relaxation.</p>
